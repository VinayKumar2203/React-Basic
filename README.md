# React-Basic

# What is React
--> React is a library of JavaScript and react is helpful for building user interfaces.

# who made react 
--> React was developed by a software engineer who is working in Facebook and her name is Jordan Walke. jordan walke created react to address the challenges of building complex and dynamic user interfaces at facebook. The react is release in may 2013, and it was open-sourced in March 2015.

# What is Babel ?
-->Babel is a javascript compiler. That allows developers to write code  using the latest ECMAScript standards and feratures,and then it transforms or transpiles that code into an older version of javascript that is widely supported by browsers.

# How does Babel convert html code in React into valid code?
--> Babel primarily focuses on JavaScript transformations, including the coversion of JSX(JavaScript XML) syntax in React into valid JavaScript code . JSX is syntax extension used in React to describe the structure of components in a syntax that look similar to xml or HTML. 

jxs:
let ele=<h1> vinay </h1>

Babel Transformation
let ele=React.createElement('h1(element)',null(attrebuite), "vinay"(children));


## What is ReactDOM used for? Write an example?
--> ReactDOM is a part of the React library that helps turn your React components into something you can see on a web page. It's like the bridge between your React code and the actual HTML document that users interact with. So, if you want your React app to show up in a browser, you use ReactDOM to make it happen.

## What are the packages that you need to import for react to work with?
-->The Browser does not understand React, it only understands HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. So to convert React into valid JavaScript we use a webpack called Babel. It is used to convert JSX into objects and then return that object. Babel is already included in the boilerplate generated by create-react-app.

..Creating React Application
Step 1: Use this command to create the react project
"npx create-react-app reactapp"

Step 2: After creating your project folder, move to it using the following command:

"cd reactapp"


after complete the assignment than you run this 

"npm start"

## what is createElement?
-->React.createElement is a function in React that is used to create React elements, which represent the building blocks of a React application's UI. React elements are lightweight descriptions of what the component should render. The createElement function takes three arguments:

## What are the three properties that createElement accept?

Type: The type of the element to be created. It can be a string representing an HTML tag name (e.g., 'div', 'h1') for native HTML elements, or it can be a reference to a React component.

Props (Optional): An object containing properties (attributes) that you want to set on the element or pass to the component.

Children (Optional): The content or child elements that should be nested inside the created element or component.

## What is the meaning of render and root?
Meaning: In React, "render" refers to the process of turning a React component into UI elements. It involves creating a virtual representation of the component's output, which can then be efficiently updated and rendered to the actual DOM.
Usage: The render method is a lifecycle method in React components. It is responsible for returning the JSX (or React elements) that represent what should be displayed on the screen.
Root:

Meaning: The "root" typically refers to the root element in the HTML document where your React application is attached. It's the top-level container where your React components will be rendered.
Usage: In the context of React's ReactDOM.render method, you specify the root element as the location where your React component tree should be inserted into the HTML document.
